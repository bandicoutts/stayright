## Decisions

### [DECISION-001] Tech stack selection
**Date:** 2026-03-21
**Status:** Decided
**Decided by:** David Flynn-Coutts (founder)

**Decision:**
The StayRight stack is Next.js 14+ (App Router) for frontend and API routes, Supabase for database and auth, Vercel for hosting, GitHub for version control, Stripe for payments, and Resend for transactional email. TypeScript throughout with strict mode enabled.

**Reasoning:**
Next.js + Supabase + Vercel is the most common stack for SaaS products at this stage and has the best agent support in Antigravity. App Router gives server-side rendering, API routes, and Vercel deployment in one package without a separate Node server. Supabase provides Postgres, auth, and Row Level Security out of the box, reducing the amount of auth infrastructure to build from scratch.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Plain Node + Express — rejected. More setup overhead, no SSR, separate deployment needed.
- Firebase — rejected. NoSQL is a poor fit for the relational data model (users → profiles → trips). Rolling window queries are easier in Postgres.
- Remix — rejected. Smaller ecosystem and less agent tooling support than Next.js at this stage.

**Consequences:**
All API routes live in src/app/api/. Server components handle data fetching. The calculation engine runs server-side to ensure accuracy. Supabase RLS policies are the primary data security layer.

### [DECISION-002] Absence day counting formula
**Date:** 2026-03-21
**Status:** Decided
**Decided by:** David Flynn-Coutts (founder), verified against official Home Office guidance

**Decision:**
Absence days are calculated as: `absence_days = (return_date - departure_date) - 1`

Neither the departure day nor the return day counts as a day of absence. Only full days spent entirely outside the UK are counted.

Example: Depart 1 March, return 8 March = 6 days absent (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 March)

Example: Depart 1 March, return 2 March = 0 days absent (no full days outside UK)

**Reasoning:**
This matches the official Home Office guidance in Appendix Continuous Residence and is confirmed by multiple immigration barristers. Both the departure day and return day count as days of presence in the UK, not absence. Only whole days are counted. Part-day absences under 24 hours are not counted.

Conservative protection is applied through warning thresholds (120 days and 150 days) rather than through a non-standard formula. This ensures calculations match what the Home Office uses while giving users a meaningful safety margin.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Count departure day as an absence — rejected. Some solicitors recommend this as a personal buffer for their clients, but it does not match the official Home Office formula and would cause StayRight's calculations to differ from the SET(O) form guidance.
- Count both departure and return as absences — rejected. Same reason. Would overcount absences and potentially cause users to curtail travel unnecessarily.

**Consequences:**
The calculation engine must implement this formula exactly. Unit tests must cover the edge cases: same-day return (0 days), next-day return (0 days), and the standard case.

A disclaimer must appear on the dashboard and in the PDF export: "Calculations follow official Home Office guidance. Always verify with an immigration adviser if you are approaching the limit."

### [DECISION-003] No native mobile app in v1
**Date:** 2026-03-21
**Status:** Decided
**Decided by:** David Flynn-Coutts (founder), recommended by PM review

**Decision:**
No native iOS or Android app will be built in v1. The web app will be fully responsive and mobile-optimised, and will be built as a PWA (Progressive Web App) so it can be installed on mobile home screens.

**Reasoning:**
The core use case (trip planning before booking) happens on desktop. Building two platforms doubles engineering surface area for auth, data sync, bug fixes, and platform-specific UI. A responsive PWA covers 80% of mobile value at 10% of the cost. PM review confirmed this is the right call for v1.

**Alternatives considered:**
- React Native — rejected for v1. Significant additional complexity, separate build pipeline, App Store/Play Store submissions.
- Flutter — rejected for v1. Same reasons as React Native. Good option for v2.
- Capacitor wrapper around the web app — rejected. Adds complexity without meaningful UX benefit over a PWA at this stage.

**Consequences:**
The web app must be fully responsive at 390px, 768px, and 1280px+ breakpoints. The PWA manifest and service worker must be configured so users can install the app on their home screen. Push notifications for alerts must use the Web Push API rather than native push notifications.

Mobile is the first priority for v2 once product-market fit is established on web.

### [DECISION-004] Freemium model with 3-trip free tier
**Date:** 2026-03-21
**Status:** Decided
**Decided by:** David Flynn-Coutts (founder), recommended by PM review

**Decision:**
The free tier allows up to 3 trips logged. Pro is £2.99/month or £24.99/year. No family tier in v1. No 14-day free trial — the free tier itself serves as the trial experience.

**Reasoning:**
A 3-trip free tier lets users experience the core "what if" calculation before hitting the paywall, without giving away so much that there's no incentive to upgrade. The paywall triggers naturally at the point users are invested enough to pay. Dropping the 14-day trial removes billing complexity (trial period tracking, trial expiry, trial-to-paid conversion) at no meaningful cost to conversion since the free tier already demonstrates value.

**Alternatives considered:**
- 14-day free trial — rejected. Adds Stripe trial period complexity. The free tier already serves this purpose with less engineering.
- 10-trip free tier — rejected. Too generous. A user with 10 trips logged has already solved their immediate problem and has less incentive to upgrade.
- No free tier (paid only) — rejected. Creates too much friction for a new product with no brand recognition.
- Family tier at £4.99/month — rejected for v1. Multi-tenancy adds significant complexity for marginal revenue. Validate demand first.

**Consequences:**
The paywall must trigger at exactly 3 saved trips, not 3 what-if simulations. Users can run unlimited what-if calculations but can only save 3 trips. Stripe must be configured for monthly and annual plans only — no trial periods, no family plan.

**Related:** PRD.md Section 3

### [DECISION-005] Calculations are never stored, always computed on read
**Date:** 2026-03-21
**Status:** Decided
**Decided by:** David Flynn-Coutts (founder), engineering spec

**Decision:**
No calculated absence values are stored in the database. The rolling window count, peak window, compliance status, days remaining, and ILR eligibility date are all computed on read from the raw trip dates stored in the trips table.

**Reasoning:**
Storing calculated values creates a consistency risk — if a user edits or deletes a trip, all stored calculations become stale instantly. Computing on read ensures the displayed value is always correct regardless of what data changes. The calculation is fast enough (a typical user has fewer than 50 trips) that there is no performance justification for caching calculated values.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Store calculated values and invalidate on trip change — rejected. Cache invalidation logic is complex and a source of bugs. Given the high-stakes nature of the data (visa compliance), a stale cached value could have serious consequences for the user.
- Background job to recalculate on trip change — rejected. Introduces async inconsistency. User could see stale data between trip save and background recalculation.

**Consequences:**
The calculation engine in src/lib/calculations/absenceEngine.ts must be pure functions that take trip data as input and return calculated values. No database calls inside the engine. All heavy calculation happens server-side in API routes or server components, not client-side.

### [DECISION-006] Design system source of truth
**Date:** 2026-03-21
**Status:** Decided
**Decided by:** David Flynn-Coutts (founder)

**Decision:**
The design system is documented in two files: /docs/design/landing.DESIGN.md (landing page) and /docs/design/dashboard.DESIGN.md (app). Shared rules are defined in /docs/DESIGN.md which acts as the wrapper. When there is a conflict between the two surface-specific files, dashboard.DESIGN.md takes precedence.

The Stitch wireframes are visual references only. The DESIGN.md files override the wireframes on all design decisions.

**Reasoning:**
Stitch generates design systems per project. The landing page and dashboard were designed in separate Stitch projects. Merging the files risked losing specificity. Keeping them separate with a wrapper allows each surface to have the detail it needs while shared rules (primary colour, typography, elevation) are defined once and applied everywhere.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Single merged DESIGN.md — rejected. Merging two AI-generated design files risks introducing conflicts and losing component-specific detail.

**Consequences:**
Engineers working on the landing page read landing.DESIGN.md. Engineers working on the app read dashboard.DESIGN.md. Both read the shared rules in /docs/DESIGN.md. If a component appears in both files with conflicting rules, dashboard.DESIGN.md wins.

**Related:** /docs/DESIGN.md, /docs/WIREFRAMES.md

### [DECISION-007] Wireframe folder structure
**Date:** 2026-03-21
**Status:** Decided
**Decided by:** David Flynn-Coutts (founder)

**Decision:**
Wireframes are stored in /docs/wireframes/ preserving the original Stitch export folder structure. Landing page screens are in /docs/wireframes/landingpage2/ and all authenticated app screens are in /docs/wireframes/web2/. Subfolders use the original Stitch naming convention (e.g. v3_dashboard_overview/).

**Reasoning:**
Manually renaming and reorganising 20+ folders and files added unnecessary effort with no meaningful benefit to the engineer. The original Stitch naming is descriptive enough. The WIREFRAMES.md index maps each folder to its screen purpose, so engineers do not need to rely on the folder names alone.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Rename and reorganise into semantic folders (auth/, dashboard/, trips/ etc.) — rejected. High effort, low value. The index in WIREFRAMES.md provides the same navigation.

**Consequences:**
Any reference to wireframe file paths in documentation must use the landingpage2/ and web2/ folder structure. The WIREFRAMES.md index is the canonical map between screen names and folder locations.

**Related:** /docs/WIREFRAMES.md

### [DECISION-013] Database schema — three tables: profiles, trips, subscriptions
**Date:** 2026-03-21
**Status:** Decided
**Decided by:** Engineering

**Decision:**
The StayRight database has three tables in the `public` schema:

- `profiles` — extends `auth.users` with visa profile data (visa route, visa start date) and notification preferences. One row per user, created automatically on signup via trigger.
- `trips` — one row per UK absence period. Stores `departure_date`, `return_date` (nullable — null means currently abroad), `destination` (free text), and `notes`. No calculated values stored (DECISION-005).
- `subscriptions` — one row per user. Stores Stripe IDs, plan (`free` | `pro_monthly` | `pro_annual` | `pro_lifetime`), and status. Writable only by service role (Stripe webhooks); users can read their own row.

**Reasoning:**
Three tables maps cleanly to the three data domains. Keeping notification preferences in `profiles` avoids a separate `notification_settings` table for what is a simple set of boolean toggles. Keeping Stripe IDs in `subscriptions` (separate from `profiles`) means the payments domain is isolated and the service role writes are scoped to one table.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Storing notification prefs in a separate table — rejected. Five boolean columns on `profiles` is simpler and there is no use case for querying notification prefs independently of the profile.
- Storing Stripe IDs on `profiles` — rejected. Mixes payment concerns into the profile table. Subscription writes need service role bypass; isolating to one table makes the RLS policy clearer.
- Using Supabase's built-in `user_metadata` for profile data — rejected. Not queryable with standard SQL; no type safety; harder to enforce constraints.

**Consequences:**
All API routes and server components fetch profile + subscription data together for most authenticated requests. A helper that returns `{ profile, subscription }` for the current user avoids duplicate queries.

### [DECISION-014] @supabase/ssr for Next.js App Router; separate browser, server, and admin clients
**Date:** 2026-03-21
**Status:** Decided
**Decided by:** Engineering

**Decision:**
Three Supabase client functions are defined in `src/lib/supabase/`:

- `client.ts` — `createClient()` using `@supabase/ssr` `createBrowserClient`. Use in Client Components (`'use client'`).
- `server.ts` — `createClient()` using `@supabase/ssr` `createServerClient` with Next.js `cookies()`. Use in Server Components, Server Actions, and Route Handlers.
- `admin.ts` — `createAdminClient()` using the base `@supabase/supabase-js` client with the service role key. Bypasses RLS. Use only in API routes (Stripe webhooks, server-side admin operations). Never import in Client Components.

**Reasoning:**
`@supabase/ssr` is the Supabase-recommended package for Next.js App Router. It handles cookie-based session management required for SSR. The browser/server split is required because App Router Server Components cannot use browser APIs. The admin client is separated into its own file so it is impossible to accidentally import it on the client — the service role key would be exposed if bundled client-side.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Using `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` — rejected. Deprecated in favour of `@supabase/ssr`.
- Single client for all contexts — rejected. Browser and server clients require different cookie handling. Mixing them causes session management bugs in SSR.

**Consequences:**
Developers must always use the correct client for the context: `src/lib/supabase/client.ts` in Client Components, `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` everywhere else, `src/lib/supabase/admin.ts` only for privileged operations.

### [DECISION-015] Next.js middleware handles session refresh and route protection
**Date:** 2026-03-21
**Status:** Decided
**Decided by:** Engineering

**Decision:**
`src/middleware.ts` runs on every non-static request and handles two things: (1) refreshes the Supabase session so tokens do not expire mid-session; (2) redirects unauthenticated users away from authenticated routes (`/dashboard`, `/trips`, `/reports`, `/settings`, `/onboarding`) to `/login`, and redirects authenticated users away from auth pages (`/login`, `/signup`) to `/dashboard`.

**Reasoning:**
Supabase's `@supabase/ssr` documentation requires session refresh in middleware to prevent token expiry in Server Components. Combining route protection in the same middleware avoids a separate auth check in every Server Component or layout.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Per-layout auth check in Server Components — rejected. Requires duplicating the session check in every layout and still needs the middleware session refresh. More code, same result.

**Consequences:**
Any new authenticated route must be added to the `isAppRoute` check in `src/middleware.ts`. Any new public route does not need any changes — it is public by default.

**Related:** DECISION-013, DECISION-014

### [DECISION-010] Multi-leg trips are a single trip record
**Date:** 2026-03-21
**Status:** Decided
**Decided by:** David Flynn-Coutts (founder)

**Decision:**
A multi-leg trip (e.g. London → Dubai → Bangkok → London) is stored as a single trip record. The record uses the first UK departure date and the final UK return date. Intermediate destinations and stopover dates are not tracked by the calculation engine. Users may record multiple destinations in the trip notes field for their own reference. The trip log shows one row per trip record.

**Reasoning:**
The Home Office assesses when the applicant left the UK and when they came back — not where they went in between. Tracking intermediate legs adds schema complexity and UI complexity (multi-row trip entries, leg-level editing) with no compliance benefit. The calculation is identical whether the trip has one destination or ten. One record per UK departure/return pair keeps the data model simple and the UI uncluttered.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Track each leg as a separate trip record — rejected. Overcomplicates the schema, the trip list UI, and the editing flow. Does not change the absence calculation.
- Add a "legs" sub-table under trips — rejected. Same overengineering problem. No ILR compliance benefit.

**Consequences:**
The `trips` table has one row per UK absence period. The destination field is a free-text string; users enter whatever is meaningful to them ("Dubai and Bangkok", "Multiple destinations"). The notes field is available for additional detail. The what-if simulator and trip log both operate on first-departure/final-return dates only.

### [DECISION-011] Crown Dependencies count as UK presence; BOTs count as absence
**Date:** 2026-03-21
**Status:** Decided
**Decided by:** David Flynn-Coutts (founder)

**Decision:**
Following the 2025 rule update, time spent in Jersey, Guernsey, and the Isle of Man counts toward UK continuous residence. If a trip's destination is one of these three Crown Dependencies, the calculation engine returns `absence_days = 0` regardless of the dates entered.

All other destinations outside Great Britain and Northern Ireland count as absence, including British Overseas Territories (Gibraltar, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands, etc.). This is the conservative and safe approach — BOTs are not part of the UK for immigration purposes and Home Office guidance on discretion is ambiguous.

All trip detail views display a permanent note: "Time in Crown Dependencies (Jersey, Guernsey, Isle of Man) does not count as absence. Time in British Overseas Territories (Gibraltar, Bermuda etc.) does count as absence. If you are unsure, consult an immigration adviser."

**Reasoning:**
The Crown Dependencies exception is settled law following the 2025 update and must be implemented correctly. The BOT position is deliberately conservative — treating BOT time as absence protects users. If the Home Office later clarifies that certain BOTs count as presence, this can be updated without data migration (calculations are always computed on read).

**Alternatives considered:**
- Treat all non-UK destinations as absence — rejected. Would incorrectly penalise users who spent time in Crown Dependencies after the 2025 rule change.
- Ask users to manually flag Crown Dependency trips — rejected. Adds UI friction and risks user error on a legal question where StayRight should be authoritative.
- Treat BOTs as UK presence — rejected. Home Office guidance is ambiguous. Conservative approach protects users from inadvertently breaching.

**Consequences:**
The engine must check whether a trip's destination matches the Crown Dependencies list before applying the standard formula. The destination field is free text, so matching requires normalised comparison (case-insensitive, alias-aware: "Jersey", "St Helier", "Isle of Man", "IOM", etc. should all match). A curated destination list with Crown Dependency flags is required in the data model.

### [DECISION-012] Monthly summary email — 7-section HTML format with plain text fallback
**Date:** 2026-03-21
**Status:** Decided
**Decided by:** David Flynn-Coutts (founder)

**Decision:**
The monthly summary email is an HTML email sent via Resend on the 1st of each month to all Pro users with the monthly summary toggle enabled. It has 7 sections: Header, Status Card, Key Stats, Recent Trips, Next Known Trip, CTA Button, Footer. A plain text fallback is always generated alongside the HTML version. The full spec is in PRD Section 4i.

**Reasoning:**
A structured HTML email with a status card and progress bar communicates compliance status more effectively than plain text. The 7-section order follows the user's attention: status first, then context (stats, recent trips), then action (CTA). Keeping recent trips to a maximum of 3 rows prevents the email from becoming a full trip dump — that's what the app is for.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Plain text only — rejected. Compliance information benefits from visual hierarchy (colour-coded risk badge, progress bar). Plain text fallback is still required for email client compatibility.
- Link to a hosted web version of the report — rejected. Adds a hosted page that must be generated and secured. The CTA to log in to the dashboard achieves the same goal without extra infrastructure.

**Consequences:**
The Resend email template must be built as a React Email component (or equivalent) that accepts the monthly stats as props and renders both HTML and plain text. The template must match the StayRight brand (#006948 header, Manrope headlines, Inter body, white background). The subject line uses the dynamic pattern from PRD Section 5.9.

### [DECISION-008] Tailwind v4 CSS-based configuration
**Date:** 2026-03-21
**Status:** Decided
**Decided by:** Engineering (build constraint)

**Decision:**
The project uses Tailwind CSS v4, which is installed by `create-next-app@16`. Tailwind v4 does not use a `tailwind.config.ts` file. All theme configuration (colors, fonts, radius) is done via `@theme` blocks in `src/app/globals.css`. Design tokens are also exported as CSS custom properties from `src/styles/tokens.css`.

**Reasoning:**
`create-next-app@16` (the latest version at the time of initialisation) automatically installs Tailwind v4. Migrating to v3 for a config file would add unnecessary complexity. Tailwind v4's `@theme` blocks provide equivalent configurability and integrate cleanly with CSS custom properties.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Downgrade to Tailwind v3 — rejected. Would require pinning the dependency and fighting against the framework default.
- Maintain a `tailwind.config.ts` alongside CSS — rejected. Not valid in Tailwind v4; the JS config is ignored.

**Consequences:**
Color and font utilities use the `@theme` CSS variable names. Engineers should reference `src/app/globals.css @theme` block to see available utility classes. Custom colors are referenced with `text-[#006948]` syntax or via theme variables.

### [DECISION-009] Root layout holds fonts; marketing layout is a segment wrapper
**Date:** 2026-03-21
**Status:** Decided
**Decided by:** Engineering (Next.js App Router constraint)

**Decision:**
Manrope and Inter fonts are loaded via `next/font/google` in `src/app/layout.tsx` (the root layout). The `(marketing)` route group layout (`src/app/(marketing)/layout.tsx`) is a simple segment wrapper that only exports SEO metadata — it does not include `<html>` or `<body>` tags.

**Reasoning:**
Next.js App Router requires exactly one `<html>` and `<body>` element, provided by the root layout. Nested layouts must not repeat these. Fonts loaded in the root layout are available to all routes including the future authenticated app under `(app)/`.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Load fonts separately in each route group layout — rejected. Not permitted; multiple `<html>` elements cause a build error.

**Consequences:**
All routes in the app have Manrope and Inter available via CSS variables `--font-manrope` and `--font-inter`. The root layout metadata is minimal; route-group and page-level `metadata` exports provide the actual SEO content.

**Related:** DECISION-001, PRD Section 4k

---

### [DECISION-016] Auth screens architecture — server/client split and route layout
**Date:** 2026-03-21
**Status:** Decided
**Decided by:** Engineering

**Decision:**
Auth screens live in the `(auth)` route group (`src/app/(auth)/`), sharing a common layout that provides the logo header, centered content area, and footer. Each auth page owns its own content. Pages that handle form submission are client components (`'use client'`). Pages that only need to read `searchParams` or render static content are server components.

The login page (`/login`) is split into a thin server component (`page.tsx`) that reads `searchParams` (required in Next.js 16 where `searchParams` is a Promise) and a client component (`LoginForm.tsx`) that holds all form state. This avoids the `useSearchParams()` Suspense boundary requirement.

The Supabase auth code exchange is handled by a Route Handler at `/auth/callback`. The `next` query parameter controls where the user lands after a successful exchange: `/onboarding` for new signups and Google OAuth, `/auth/new-password` for password resets, `/dashboard` as the default.

**Reasoning:**
Next.js 16 made `params` and `searchParams` asynchronous (Promises). Client components cannot `await` them, and `useSearchParams()` requires a `<Suspense>` boundary. The server wrapper pattern eliminates both issues without adding a boundary component. The `(auth)` route group gives these screens their own layout (minimal, centred) without affecting URLs.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Use `useSearchParams()` wrapped in `<Suspense>` — works but adds boilerplate for every client page that needs URL params.
- Put auth pages at root level without a route group — rejected. No shared layout, more repetition across pages.
- Use middleware to handle auth redirects from the callback — rejected. The callback is a Route Handler; middleware cannot inspect auth codes.

**Consequences:**
Any new auth-related page (e.g. account linking, MFA setup) should follow the same pattern: place in `(auth)/`, use the server wrapper if `searchParams` are needed, keep form logic in a client component. Add the route to the `isAuthRoute` check in `src/middleware.ts` if logged-in users should be redirected away.

### [DECISION-017] Onboarding state persisted via `onboarding_completed` column
**Date:** 2026-03-21
**Status:** Decided
**Decided by:** Engineering

**Decision:**
A boolean column `onboarding_completed` (default `false`) is added to the `profiles` table to track whether a user has finished or skipped onboarding. The onboarding layout server components read this flag and redirect to `/dashboard` if it is true. When a user completes or skips onboarding, the flag is set to `true` via a Server Action before redirecting. Mid-flow persistence is achieved by reading from the DB: if `visa_start_date IS NOT NULL` but `onboarding_completed IS FALSE`, the user is placed at the trips step.

Server Actions (`src/app/(app)/onboarding/actions.ts`) handle all DB writes: `saveVisaProfileAction` (step 1), `saveTripAction` / `deleteTripAction` (step 2), `skipOnboardingAction`, and `completeOnboardingAction`. Each trip is saved to the DB immediately when added, so the list is durable across sessions.

**Reasoning:**
A DB flag is the simplest durable signal. `localStorage` would be lost on a different device; session storage is lost on tab close. Inferring completion from data presence (e.g. `visa_start_date IS NOT NULL`) is ambiguous — a user might have set their visa date but never finished trip entry. An explicit flag eliminates all ambiguity.

**Alternatives considered:**
- `localStorage` for onboarding step — rejected. Not durable across devices or browser restarts.
- Infer completion from `visa_start_date IS NOT NULL` — rejected. Ambiguous — doesn't distinguish mid-flow from genuinely complete.
- Separate `onboarding_step` integer column — rejected. Overkill. Three steps, and the DB data itself tells us which step was reached.

**Consequences:**
Any new onboarding step added in future must ensure `onboarding_completed` is set to `true` at the end of the final step. The `profiles.onboarding_completed` flag is the authoritative signal for all auth-callback redirects.

### [DECISION-018] Absence engine as pure TypeScript functions in src/lib/calculations/
**Date:** 2026-03-21
**Status:** Decided
**Decided by:** Engineering

**Decision:**
All 180-day absence calculations live in `src/lib/calculations/absenceEngine.ts` as pure functions with no framework dependencies. The engine exports: `calculateTripAbsenceDays`, `getCurrentRollingWindow`, `getPeakRollingWindow`, `getRiskStatus`, `getQualifyingPeriod`, `calculateWhatIf`, and `isCrownDependency`. Date arithmetic uses UTC to avoid timezone-shift bugs. Dashboard and reports call these functions server-side and pass pre-computed results as props to client components — no calculations happen in the browser.

**Reasoning:**
Pure functions are trivially unit-testable and can be imported by any server component, route handler, or cron job without framework coupling. UTC date parsing prevents off-by-one errors caused by local timezone offsets (a trip logged as "1 March" in BST must not be read as "28 February" in UTC).

**Alternatives considered:**
- Inline calculations in server components — rejected. Duplicates logic, makes testing hard.
- Store calculations in the DB — explicitly rejected in DECISION-005.
- Client-side calculations — rejected. PRD requires server-side for accuracy.

**Consequences:**
Any change to calculation logic must be made in `absenceEngine.ts`. The file carries a prominent warning comment. Future unit tests should target this file exclusively.

### [DECISION-019] App shell uses (main) route group with sidebar layout
**Date:** 2026-03-21
**Status:** Decided
**Decided by:** Engineering

**Decision:**
Authenticated app screens (dashboard, trips, reports, settings) live under `src/app/(app)/(main)/`. The `(main)` layout is a server component that fetches the authenticated user and renders the `Sidebar` client component. The `Sidebar` uses `usePathname()` for active-state highlighting and handles sign-out client-side via `supabase.auth.signOut()`. Onboarding uses its own layout outside `(main)` since it has different chrome.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Single layout for all authenticated routes — rejected. Onboarding needs minimal chrome; the app needs a sidebar.
- Client-side layout with useEffect for auth check — rejected. Server component auth check is simpler and avoids flash of unauthenticated content.

**Consequences:**
All future authenticated screens (trips, reports, settings) go in `(app)/(main)/`. Each new route needs to be added to the `NAV_ITEMS` array in `Sidebar.tsx` when it's ready to be navigable.

### [DECISION-020] Trip flow pages are standalone routes, not overlay modals
**Date:** 2026-03-21
**Status:** Decided
**Decided by:** Engineering

**Decision:**
`/trips/plan`, `/trips/log`, and `/trips/[id]/edit` are implemented as standalone Next.js App Router pages rather than client-side overlay modals. The "modal" language in the PRD is UI intent, not a technical specification. After a save or cancel action, users are redirected to `/trips` via `router.push('/trips')`.

**Reasoning:**
Standalone pages are simpler to implement, have better URL semantics (users can bookmark or deep-link), support browser back navigation natively, and integrate cleanly with Next.js Server Components for data loading. Client-side modal routing would require URL state management (e.g. `?modal=plan`) plus a parallel route or intercepting route, adding significant complexity with no user-facing benefit.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Next.js intercepting routes (`@modal`) — rejected. Adds folder structure complexity and intercepting route edge cases (direct navigation, hard refresh). Not worth the overhead for three forms.
- `?action=plan` URL state + client-side modal — rejected. Requires the trips page to be a client component to read the URL state, and the calculation data must still be fetched server-side.

**Consequences:**
`/trips/plan`, `/trips/log`, and `/trips/[id]/edit` are regular pages under `(app)/(main)/trips/`. Each loads its data server-side and renders `TripFlowClient`. The user experience is functionally equivalent to a modal — the sidebar is preserved and the back button works.

### [DECISION-021] Paywall modal UI is built; Stripe Checkout is deferred to payments sprint
**Date:** 2026-03-21
**Status:** Decided
**Decided by:** Engineering

**Decision:**
The `PaywallModal` component (`src/components/app/trips/PaywallModal.tsx`) is fully built to the PRD §4l spec — including plan selection cards, benefit list, and CTA button — but clicking "Upgrade to Pro" shows a "Coming soon" toast rather than opening Stripe Checkout. The Stripe integration will be wired in the dedicated payments sprint.

The component accepts an `inline` prop. When `inline={true}`, it renders as a full-width card (no overlay backdrop), used on `/trips/plan` and `/trips/log` when a Free user has reached the 3-trip limit. When `inline={false}` (default), it renders as a focus-trapped overlay modal, used from the `TripsClient` add trip button.

**Reasoning:**
Building the paywall UI now ensures paywall triggers are correctly gated in the trip flow. Deferring Stripe prevents blocking the trip feature on payment infrastructure. The `inline` variant avoids shipping dead pages (a Free user navigating to `/trips/plan` with 3 trips would otherwise see an empty page).

**Alternatives considered:**
- Skip the paywall UI until Stripe is ready — rejected. Paywall gates must be present for Free users to avoid broken flows. The UI stub communicates intent correctly.
- Redirect to a dedicated paywall page — rejected. A redirect to `/upgrade` is a worse user experience than an inline gate on the page they already navigated to.

**Consequences:**
When the payments sprint is built, `handleUpgrade()` in `PaywallModal.tsx` must be wired to the Stripe Checkout Server Action. No other changes are required in the trip flow.

### [DECISION-022] calculateWhatIf uses return_date as the `today` parameter for future trips
**Date:** 2026-03-21
**Status:** Decided
**Decided by:** Engineering

**Decision:**
In `TripFlowClient.tsx`, the live what-if calculation calls `calculateWhatIf(existingTrips, hypotheticalTrip, new Date(return_date), visaStartDate)` — passing the hypothetical trip's return date as the `today` parameter instead of the current date.

**Reasoning:**
`calculateWhatIf` calls `getCurrentRollingWindow` with the provided `today`, which calculates a 12-month window ending on that date. If `today = new Date()` (the current date) and the trip departs in 3 months, the rolling window is `[today − 1 year, today]`. Future absence days are outside this window and would not be counted, giving a misleadingly safe result. Passing `today = return_date` computes the rolling window as `[return_date − 1 year, return_date]`, which correctly shows the user where they will stand when they return.

This gives the user the right answer to the question: "How many days will I have used when I get back from this trip?"

**Alternatives considered:**
- Use `new Date()` as today — rejected. Correct for past and present trips but gives wrong results for any future trip, which is the primary use case of the "Plan a Trip" feature.
- Create a new engine function that projects forward — rejected. `calculateWhatIf` already accepts a `today` parameter for exactly this reason. No new function needed.

**Consequences:**
The live calculation on `/trips/plan` correctly projects the rolling window forward to the return date. For past trips (log/edit mode), `return_date` is in the past, so this has no difference in behaviour — the window ends before today, which is the correct snapshot.

### [DECISION-023] PDF generation library and execution pattern
**Date:** 2026-03-21
**Status:** Decided
**Decided by:** David Flynn-Coutts

**Decision:**
Use `@react-pdf/renderer` v4.3.2 for PDF generation. PDF documents are generated **client-side only**, via a dynamic `import()` inside the "Download PDF" button click handler in `ReportsClient`. The PDF Blob is created in the browser and downloaded directly — no server action, no API route, no Vercel function involvement.

**Reasoning:**
PDF generation only happens on explicit user action, so there is no need to involve the server. Client-side generation keeps the serverless functions small, avoids cold-start latency for a non-critical path, and simplifies the architecture. The library was verified compatible before installation: peer deps support React `^19.0.0`, no browser-only APIs in the source (`HTMLCanvasElement`, `window`, `document` are absent), ESM-only but handled correctly by Next.js 16 Turbopack via `import()`. On-disk footprint is 3MB — no risk of Vercel's 250MB bundle size limit.

**Alternatives considered:**
- **pdf-lib** — low-level, no React integration, would require manual coordinate-based layout for every table cell. Viable but significantly more code for the same result.
- **Puppeteer / Playwright** — headless browser spins up a full Chromium instance. ~400MB+ dependency, Vercel serverless size limit risk, cold starts. Rejected.
- **Server-side @react-pdf/renderer** (via Server Action or API route) — technically works (no browser APIs required), but adds unnecessary serverless complexity when the trigger is a client button click. Deferred unless server-side PDF generation becomes a requirement (e.g. auto-emailing reports).
- **@vercel/og / Satori** — designed for OpenGraph image generation (SVG→PNG), not document PDFs. Does not produce multi-page downloadable PDFs. Rejected.

**Consequences:**
PDF generation is browser-only. If server-side generation is ever required (e.g. automatically emailing a PDF report as part of the monthly notification job), the pattern will need revisiting — most likely a dedicated API route using the server-compatible execution path of `@react-pdf/renderer`.

### [DECISION-024] Recent exports list deferred — no DB table in v1
**Date:** 2026-03-21
**Status:** Decided
**Decided by:** David Flynn-Coutts

**Decision:**
The PRD §4g acceptance criterion "Recent exports are shown in a sidebar list with date, type, and re-download option" and the associated stale-data warning are deferred from v1. The Reports page shows the three report type cards and generates PDFs on demand — no report generation history is persisted to the database.

**Reasoning:**
Implementing a `report_exports` table requires an additional Supabase migration, a `updated_at`-based staleness check against the trips table, and a re-download flow (which is simply re-generation from current data anyway). Since Stripe is not yet built, no user is on a paid Pro plan in the current deployment — the feature cannot be meaningfully tested. Deferring keeps the v1 surface area focused.

**Alternatives considered:**
- localStorage-based history — breaks across devices, not acceptable for a compliance tool.
- Full DB table with report history — correct long-term approach; deferred to v1.1.

**Consequences:**
Free users see all three report cards but hit the paywall on any "Download PDF" click. Pro users generate PDFs on demand. No generation history is shown. The stale-data warning is not implemented. Add `report_exports` table and stale detection in the first post-launch iteration.

### [DECISION-025] `notes` field maps to "Reason for Travel" in ILR Absence Table PDF
**Date:** 2026-03-21
**Status:** Decided
**Decided by:** David Flynn-Coutts

**Decision:**
The ILR Absence Table PDF includes a "Reason for Travel" column (matching the SET(O) form format). The `trips.notes` field is used as the value for this column. No separate `reason_for_travel` field is added to the trips table or trip form.

**Reasoning:**
The PRD specifies a "Reason for Travel" column in the PDF but does not specify a distinct form field for it — the trip form has a `notes` field which serves the same semantic purpose. Adding a separate field would require a DB migration and an extra input in the trip form for marginal gain. Users who want to capture travel reasons can use the notes field.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Add a `reason_for_travel` column to `trips` table — requires migration, extra UI. Deferred.

**Consequences:**
The trip form's "Notes" field implicitly serves as "Reason for Travel" for ILR report purposes. This should be noted in the trip form placeholder text and/or help copy in a future iteration.

### [DECISION-026] Account deletion is a hard delete in v1
**Date:** 2026-03-21
**Status:** Decided
**Decided by:** David Flynn-Coutts

**Decision:**
`deleteAccountAction` performs an immediate hard delete: trips → subscriptions → profiles → auth user (via admin client). The PRD §4h data retention policy ("soft-deleted, retained 30 days") is not implemented in v1.

**Reasoning:**
Soft-delete with 30-day recovery requires a `deleted_at` column on all tables, a scheduled cleanup job (cron or Supabase Edge Function), and a recovery flow. None of these infrastructure pieces exist yet. For v1, hard delete is safe and simpler. The 30-day retention policy is an aspirational goal that requires a post-launch engineering sprint to implement properly.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Add `deleted_at` column and soft-delete immediately — requires migration on all three tables and a scheduler.

**Consequences:**
Account deletion is irreversible in v1. The UI makes this explicit ("This action cannot be undone") and requires typing "delete my account" to confirm. Post-launch: add `deleted_at` to profiles/trips/subscriptions and a scheduled Edge Function to purge rows older than 30 days.

**Related:** PRD Section 4h; `src/app/(app)/(main)/settings/actions.ts`

### [DECISION-027] Stripe integration pattern: server-side API routes, client redirect
**Date:** 2026-03-21
**Status:** Decided
**Decided by:** David Flynn-Coutts

**Decision:**
Stripe Checkout and Customer Portal sessions are created via Next.js API route handlers (`POST /api/stripe/checkout`, `POST /api/stripe/portal`). The client fetches the session URL and performs `window.location.href = url` to redirect. Webhooks are handled at `POST /api/stripe/webhook` using `request.text()` for raw body access (required for Stripe signature verification). The production URL is `https://stayright.vercel.app` (Vercel project: stayright, linked to main branch). The Stripe webhook endpoint is `https://stayright.vercel.app/api/stripe/webhook` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` must be set to `https://stayright.vercel.app` in Vercel environment variables.

**Reasoning:**
API routes (not Server Actions) are used because Checkout and Portal session creation requires returning a URL to the client for redirect — Server Actions cannot return raw redirect URLs to the browser in this way. The webhook route requires raw body access for signature verification; App Router route handlers receive the raw body via `request.text()` without any parser configuration needed.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Server Actions for checkout — cannot return a URL for `window.location.href` redirect in a type-safe way without additional complexity.
- `@stripe/stripe-js` + client-side `redirectToCheckout` — deprecated by Stripe in favour of server-created sessions with URL redirect.

**Consequences:**
Three Stripe env vars must be set before payments work: `STRIPE_PRICE_MONTHLY`, `STRIPE_PRICE_ANNUAL`, `STRIPE_PRICE_LIFETIME`. The Stripe webhook endpoint must be registered in the Stripe Dashboard pointing to `{NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL}/api/stripe/webhook` with events: `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.updated`, `customer.subscription.deleted`, `invoice.payment_failed`. Webhooks are idempotent (upsert on `user_id`). Payment failures set `subscriptions.status = 'past_due'`, which triggers the red banner in the app layout.

### [DECISION-028] Email notifications: Resend SDK, Vercel Cron Jobs, threshold deduplication via profile columns
**Date:** 2026-03-21
**Status:** Decided
**Decided by:** David Flynn-Coutts

**Decision:**
Transactional email is delivered via the Resend SDK (server-only). Scheduled emails (monthly summary, daily threshold/reminder checks) run as Vercel Cron Jobs defined in `vercel.json`. Cron routes are protected by a `CRON_SECRET` env var checked against `Authorization: Bearer <secret>`. Threshold deduplication is handled by three new columns on `profiles`: `notified_120_day_at`, `notified_150_day_at`, `notified_monthly_summary_at`. The monthly cron uses idempotency (checks if already sent this calendar month). The return reminder uses departure_date arithmetic (fires for trips where `return_date IS NULL` AND `departure_date = today - 3`) to avoid a separate tracking column. The welcome email is sent in the auth callback immediately after `exchangeCodeForSession` succeeds for new users (detected by `created_at < 5 min ago`). All email sends are wrapped in try-catch so failures never block the user experience.

**Reasoning:**
Resend was chosen because it is the only provider currently in `.env.local.example` and it supports React Email / HTML string templates. Vercel Cron Jobs require no additional infrastructure (no separate cron service, no Supabase Edge Functions). Profile columns are the simplest deduplication mechanism that avoids a separate `notification_log` table. The departure_date arithmetic trick for return reminders avoids a `return_reminder_sent_at` column on trips at the cost of missing the reminder if the cron fails on that exact day.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Supabase Edge Functions with pg_cron — more complex infrastructure, harder to iterate on locally.
- `notification_log` table for deduplication — cleaner but requires schema migration + join query on every cron run.
- Return reminder via `return_reminder_sent_at` on trips — more robust but additional column + migration.

**Consequences:**
Five new env vars required: `RESEND_API_KEY`, `CRON_SECRET`. Domain `stayright.co.uk` must be verified in Resend before sending from `hello@stayright.co.uk`. Until domain is verified, use Resend's test domain. The migration `20260321000003_notification_tracking.sql` must be applied to production Supabase before the cron jobs run.

### [DECISION-030] PWA: manifest + offline service worker; push notifications deferred to v2
**Date:** 2026-03-22
**Status:** Decided
**Decided by:** David Flynn-Coutts

**Decision:**
Implement PWA as: (1) `src/app/manifest.ts` using the Next.js 16 file convention (no library), (2) a custom service worker at `public/sw.js` with cache-first for static assets and network-first with cache fallback for page navigations, (3) production-only SW registration via a client component. Push notifications are deferred to v2.

**Reasoning:**
- The manifest file convention in Next.js 16 requires no additional library.
- A custom SW avoids the complexity and maintenance overhead of `serwist`/`next-pwa` for the simple caching strategy needed in v1.
- SW is production-only to prevent stale Turbopack chunks interfering with local development.
- Push notifications require: VAPID key management, storing per-user push subscription objects in the DB, wiring sends into the cron job, and a SW push handler. This is substantial scope. Email notifications (Resend) already cover the same alert delivery requirement for v1.

**Caching strategy:**
- `/_next/static/*` — cache-first (immutable, content-addressed by Next.js build)
- Navigation requests (HTML pages) — network-first, offline fallback to last cached version
- `/api/*`, `/auth/*` — network-only (never cache live data or auth callbacks)
- Cross-origin (Supabase, Stripe, PostHog) — not intercepted

**Offline behaviour:**
Pages visited at least once while online are available offline in read-only mode. Users who have never loaded a page while online see a brief offline message.

**Consequences:**
- Push notification requirement from PRD §1.1 is deferred — PRD updated accordingly.
- Proper rasterised PNG icons (192×192, 512×512) should be designed before public launch; current icon is SVG (supported by Chrome/Edge/Firefox; Safari uses the apple-touch-icon meta tag).
- When `stayright.app` domain is live, verify SW scope and HTTPS (SW requires HTTPS — satisfied by Vercel).

### [DECISION-029] PostHog analytics: client-only SDK, consent-gated init, typed wrapper
**Date:** 2026-03-22
**Status:** Decided
**Decided by:** David Flynn-Coutts

**Decision:**
Use `posthog-js` (v1.x, Cloud EU) for product analytics, initialised client-side only when the user has accepted analytics cookies (`cookie_consent === 'accepted'`). A module-level `initialized` flag prevents double-init and gates all `track()` / `identifyUser()` calls. Events fire from client components only — no server-side `posthog-node` usage. PostHog identifies users by their Supabase UUID only (no name, email, or IP). All 11 events from PRD §4n are instrumented.

**Reasoning:**
- `posthog-js` is purely client-side — no serverless bundle concerns and no additional server infrastructure.
- The `initialized` guard keeps analytics silent until consent is explicitly given, satisfying PRD §4m (cookie consent) and GDPR.
- Cloud EU region (`eu.i.posthog.com`) means all data stays within the EU.
- Typed `track()` union enforces the exact event names from PRD §4n at compile time.

**Architecture decisions within this scope:**
- `PostHogProvider` wraps the root layout and listens for a `cookie-consent` custom window event dispatched by `CookieBanner` (native `storage` events don't fire in the same tab).
- `PostHogIdentify` renders in the app `(main)` layout, called once per authenticated session.
- `SignupTracker` fires `signup_completed` from the onboarding welcome page when `?signup=1` is present (set by auth callback for new users).
- `SkipButton` replaces the server action form to fire `onboarding_skipped` before calling `skipOnboardingAction()`.
- `UpgradeTracker` fires `upgrade_completed` on dashboard load when `?upgraded=1` is present (set by Stripe checkout success_url).
- `what_if_used` fires once on `TripFlowClient` mount when `mode === 'plan'`.
- `paywall_shown` includes a `trigger_reason` property; all PaywallModal callers pass a reason (`trip_limit`, `plan_mode_gate`, `log_mode_gate`, `pdf_export`).

**Alternatives considered:**
- Plausible — simpler but event tracking requires a custom server-side setup; PostHog has better funnel analytics for the signup/upgrade funnel.
- `posthog-node` for server-side events — rejected to keep the implementation simple (all events are user-initiated UI actions, not background jobs).

**Consequences:**
- PostHog project must be created at posthog.com (Cloud EU region). API key must be set as `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` in Vercel environment variables.
- Basic dashboard to be created in PostHog showing: signup funnel, paywall conversion rate, PDF generation count (acceptance criterion in PRD §4n).
- If consent is later withdrawn (settings page), `optOutCapturing()` must be called.

### [DECISION-031] Trip drawer: paywall behaviour — skip drawer, fire PaywallModal on TripsClient
**Date:** 2026-03-22
**Status:** Decided
**Decided by:** David Flynn-Coutts

**Decision:**
When a free user at the 3-trip limit triggers the trip drawer (via "Plan a Trip", "Log a Past Trip", or any edit entry point), the drawer does **not** open. Instead, `setShowPaywall(true)` is called directly on `TripsClient`, firing the existing `PaywallModal` overlay. The drawer never renders paywall content. `PaywallModal` is unchanged.

**Reasoning:**
The drawer is a trip entry/edit form. Showing a paywall inside it would create a confusing experience — the user expects a form and gets a sales screen. The PaywallModal already handles this case cleanly as a standalone overlay. Keeping the two concerns separate also means zero changes to `PaywallModal` or its callers.

**Implementation rule:**
In `TripsClient`, before opening the drawer, check `!isPro && tripCount >= 3`. If true: `setShowPaywall(true)`, return early. Do not set drawer open state.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Render paywall inside the drawer — rejected. Confusing UX; the drawer is a form container, not a sales screen.
- Show inline paywall on the standalone plan/log pages as before — moot once those pages are replaced by the drawer.

### [DECISION-032] Remove Recent Trips card from dashboard — status-only view
**Date:** 2026-03-22
**Status:** Decided
**Decided by:** David Coutts

**Decision:**
The Recent Trips card (last 3 trips rendered inline on the dashboard) has been removed. The dashboard is now purely a compliance status screen: quota ring, qualifying period progress, ILR timeline, and quick-action CTAs. A compact summary line replaces the trip cards: "{n} trips logged · {n} days abroad recorded" with a "View all trips →" link to `/trips`.

**Reasoning:**
The dashboard's job is to answer "am I compliant?" at a glance. Rendering trip rows on the same screen duplicates the trips page, creates visual clutter, and distracts from the quota ring — the primary compliance indicator. The compact summary gives the same at-a-glance context (how many trips, total days) without the noise. Detailed trip history belongs on the dedicated `/trips` page.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Keep recent trips — rejected. Adds clutter without information value; the trips page is one tap away.
- Collapse recent trips behind a toggle — rejected. Unnecessary complexity; the compact summary achieves the goal more cleanly.

**Consequences:**
Dashboard page.tsx no longer imports `TripRow` or `getRiskStatus`. The `recentTrips` slice computation is removed. The compact summary replaces it with `tripCount` and `totalDaysAbroad` already computed in the dashboard.

### [DECISION-033] Split name into first_name + last_name; defer last name to settings and PDF generation
**Date:** 2026-03-22
**Status:** Decided
**Decided by:** David Coutts

**Decision:**
The user's name is split into two separate database columns: `first_name` (NOT NULL) and `last_name` (nullable). First name is collected at onboarding (visa setup step). Last name is deferred — it appears as an optional field in Settings → Visa Profile, and is only *required* when the user generates their first PDF export. If `last_name` is absent at PDF generation time, an inline prompt appears before the PDF is created: the user enters (or confirms) their first and last name, the record is saved to their profile, and the PDF generates immediately with the full name.

**Reasoning:**
Onboarding is the highest-anxiety moment in the product. The user has just signed up and wants to reach a populated dashboard as quickly as possible. Every additional required field is a reason to bounce. First name alone is sufficient for the dashboard greeting ("Good morning, David") and for identifying the user. Last name is not needed until the PDF export — which is also the moment the user has the highest motivation to provide it, because they are actively preparing documents for a Home Office application and want their name to appear correctly. Collecting last name at the point of maximum motivation rather than maximum friction is the better experience.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Collect full name at signup — rejected. Adds friction at the highest-anxiety point in the flow. Many people also don't use a "last name" in the same way (mononyms, compound names) and a mandatory single field forces awkward workarounds.
- Collect full name at onboarding visa setup step — rejected. Same reasoning as above; no feature at onboarding actually requires a last name.
- Single `name` column — rejected. Makes the PDF "last name required" check brittle (requires string splitting) and the settings UI awkward (one combined field vs. two clearly labelled fields).
- Ask for last name in settings only, not as a PDF pre-generation prompt — rejected. Users who never visit settings would be blocked at PDF generation with no clear path forward. The inline prompt is lower friction.

**Consequences:**
- `profiles` table: add `first_name text NOT NULL` and `last_name text` columns. If a `name` column already exists, write a migration to split it and drop the old column. Update all references in the codebase.
- Onboarding visa setup step: collects `first_name` only (required). No `last_name` field.
- Settings → Visa Profile: two fields — "First name" (required) and "Last name" (optional, helper text: "Used in PDF exports").
- Dashboard greeting: "Good morning, {firstName}".
- PDF generation in `ReportsClient`: check `profile.last_name` before generating. If absent, show an inline form (first name pre-filled and editable, last name required). On confirm, `upsert` the profile with both name fields, then proceed to generate. If present, generate immediately.
- PDF header: "Name: {firstName} {lastName}".
